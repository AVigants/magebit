Launch Apache;
Inside there is a 'database.txt' file - simply copy all of it and create a local database called 'magebit'. Then paste the database contents and it will create a table called 'emails' and populate it with some mock data;
There are 2 files that can be viewed: the first is the 'pineapple.' page: 'localhost/magebit-main/home.php'. The second is the database page: 'localhost/magebit-main/emails.php';
The CSV file gets saved to the same magebit-main folder.
